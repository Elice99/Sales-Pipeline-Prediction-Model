# Sales-Pipeline-Prediction-Model
This repository contains a production-ready Machine Learning API built with FastAPI for predicting the outcome (WIN or LOST) of deals in a sales pipeline. The core artifact is a pre-trained XGBoost model pipeline, which includes specialized feature engineering steps (like CatBoost Encoding and custom statistical lookups) essential for generating accurate forecasts.

The API is designed for robustness, speed, and easy containerized deployment using Docker.
